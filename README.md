# ðŸš€ Introduction

Apollo is designed to be quick and easy to write. No need for a main function, you can init one tho and it will work like the C main function for example.\
\
Example on an main function:

{% code title="main.ap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```rust
fn main: args
    put: args[1]
```
{% endcode %}

You can use the the "args" variable when defining a main function and it functions as the argv in C.\
